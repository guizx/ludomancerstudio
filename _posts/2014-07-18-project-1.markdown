description: >
  Hotel77 is a first-person psychological horror game set in a haunted hotel locked in a time loop. Ludomancer Studio handled the full-cycle production, developing modular 3D environments and a looping event system in Unity. We implemented custom logic for sanity effects, procedural corridor navigation, and environmental audio triggers. Features include dynamic lighting, collectible lore elements, a responsive UI, and puzzle scripting with temporal resets. Built with a post-processing stack designed to convey claustrophobia and psychological tension.
