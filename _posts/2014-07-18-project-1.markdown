  Hotel77 is a first-person psychological horror game set in a haunted hotel locked in a time loop. We are currently developing this project as a case study, creating multiple levels in Unity as well as a procedural corridor navigation. Features include dynamic lighting, collectible lore elements, a responsive UI, multiple languages localization, environmental audio and event triggers, and puzzle scripting.
