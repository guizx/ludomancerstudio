description: >
  Fallen Slayers is a fast-paced, top-down action roguelike where the player controls a fallen hero bound to dark patrons. Ludomancer Studio designed the core gameplay loop, procedural enemy spawning, and customizable upgrade trees. We implemented a modular stat system tied to soul, patron, and pact combinationsâ€”each changing gameplay outcomes. The game includes five distinct factions, each with custom enemy behaviors, as well as boss fights, area-of-effect abilities, conditional curses, and progression rewards using persistent currencies.
