description: >
  The Night of the Exorcism is a narrative-driven horror visual novel developed entirely in Ren'Py. Ludomancer Studio created a branching story framework with variable tracking, morality systems, and multiple outcomes based on player choices. The project included custom UI, animated transitions, and variable-based branching narrative. We also handled all scripting, localization, and audio, building a polished interactive fiction system aimed at narrative experimentation.
